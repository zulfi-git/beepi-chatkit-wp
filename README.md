# Beepi ChatKit Embed

A WordPress plugin for embedding an OpenAI ChatKit agent on WordPress pages using Cloudflare Worker endpoints for token generation.

## Description

This plugin allows you to easily embed a ChatKit-powered chat interface on your WordPress site. It connects to your Cloudflare Worker endpoints for secure token generation and refresh, ensuring seamless authentication with the OpenAI ChatKit service.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Easy integration via `[chatkit]` shortcode
- ðŸ”’ Secure token management through Cloudflare Worker endpoints
- ðŸ“± Responsive design with mobile support
- âš¡ Conditional script loading (only loads on pages using the shortcode)
- ðŸŽ¨ Customizable styling with included CSS
- ðŸ”§ Minimal configuration required

## Installation

1. Upload the `beepi-chatkit-wp` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the `CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID` constant in `beepi-chatkit-embed.php` with your ChatKit workflow ID

## Configuration

Open `beepi-chatkit-embed.php` and locate the configuration constants near the top of the file:

```php
define( 'CHATKIT_START_URL', 'https://chatkit.beepi.no/api/chatkit/start' );
define( 'CHATKIT_REFRESH_URL', 'https://chatkit.beepi.no/api/chatkit/refresh' );
define( 'CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID', '' ); // Add your workflow ID here
```

Update the `CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID` with your actual ChatKit workflow ID.

## Usage

To embed the ChatKit interface on any page or post, simply use the shortcode:

```
[chatkit]
```

The chat interface will appear where you place the shortcode.
